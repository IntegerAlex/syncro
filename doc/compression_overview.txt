COMPRESSION AND DECOMPRESSION SYSTEM
====================================

Overview
--------
The Syncro version control system uses zlib compression to efficiently store file contents
while preserving data integrity. Files are compressed when added to the repository and
decompressed when retrieved.

Key Features:
- Uses zlib's compress2() and uncompress() for reliable compression
- Stores original file size header for accurate decompression
- Single-pass compression for better performance
- Memory-efficient implementation with proper resource management
- Comprehensive error checking and reporting

File Format
-----------
Compressed files are stored in the following format:
1. 4-byte header (uint32_t) containing the original file size
2. Compressed data block

This format ensures reliable decompression even for binary files or files with special characters.

Implementation Files
-------------------
- src/commit.c: Contains the compression implementation (snapem function)
- src/inflate.c: Contains the decompression implementation (zlib_inflate function)

Dependencies
-----------
- zlib library for compression
- stdint.h for fixed-width integer types
- limits.h for PATH_MAX definition
