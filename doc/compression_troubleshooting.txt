COMPRESSION/DECOMPRESSION TROUBLESHOOTING
=========================================

Common Issues and Solutions
--------------------------

1. "Failed to read original file size header"
   - The compressed file may be corrupted or not in the expected format
   - Ensure the file was compressed with the current version of the system
   - Check file permissions and disk space

2. "Decompression failed with code X"
   - Common codes:
     - Z_MEM_ERROR (-4): Not enough memory
     - Z_DATA_ERROR (-3): Corrupted compressed data
     - Z_BUF_ERROR (-5): Output buffer too small
   - For Z_MEM_ERROR: Free up system memory
   - For Z_DATA_ERROR: The source file may be corrupted
   - For Z_BUF_ERROR: File size header may be incorrect

3. "Failed to allocate memory"
   - System is low on memory
   - Try closing other applications
   - For very large files, consider using a machine with more RAM

4. "Failed to write decompressed data"
   - Check disk space
   - Verify write permissions on the destination directory
   - Ensure the destination path exists

5. Empty buff.out file
   - Check if .syncro/refs directory exists and is writable
   - Verify that vdiff command is configured correctly
   - Make sure decompression completes successfully

Checking Compressed Files
------------------------
To verify a compressed file's integrity:
1. Use the 'syncro vdiff' command to view the file
2. Check the first 4 bytes - they should represent a reasonable file size
3. Use test_compression.sh to run a full verification

Memory Issues
------------
If Valgrind reports memory leaks:
1. Check for paths where free() might be skipped due to early returns
2. Ensure all allocated buffers are freed in error conditions
3. Verify that file handles are closed properly
