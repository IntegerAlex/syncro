# Documentation: File and Directory Handling in C

## Overview
This document provides a detailed explanation of the implementation of file and directory handling in C. The focus is on the `check_dir` function, which verifies whether a given path is a directory. Additionally, memory allocation considerations, best practices, and industry standards are discussed.

## Function: `check_dir`

### Purpose
The `check_dir` function determines whether a given file path corresponds to a directory.

### Parameters
- `const char *path`: A string representing the file path to be checked.

### Returns
- `1` if the file path corresponds to a directory.
- `0` if the file path is not a directory or does not exist.

### Implementation Details
```c
#include "dir.h"
#include <sys/stat.h>

int check_dir(const char *path) {
    struct stat st;
    if (stat(path, &st) == -1) {
        return 0; // Directory doesn't exist
    }
    return S_ISDIR(st.st_mode);
}
```

### Explanation
- `struct stat st;`  
  A `struct stat` object is used to store file metadata.
- `stat(path, &st);`  
  The `stat` system call populates the `st` structure with information about the file at `path`.
- `S_ISDIR(st.st_mode);`  
  A macro that checks if the `st_mode` field represents a directory.

If the `stat` call fails (e.g., file does not exist), the function returns `0`. Otherwise, it checks the file type and returns `1` if it is a directory.

## Memory Allocation Considerations
The `check_dir` function does not dynamically allocate memory. It uses a stack-allocated structure (`struct stat st`), making it efficient with minimal memory overhead.

### **Static Memory Allocation**
- The `struct stat` is allocated on the stack, meaning its memory is automatically managed and freed when the function returns.
- Since there are no pointers or heap allocations, there is no risk of memory leaks.

### **Dynamic Memory Allocation (Not Used Here)**
If the function were modified to use dynamically allocated memory (e.g., using `malloc` for storing the file path), it would require explicit `free()` calls to prevent memory leaks. However, the current implementation is optimal as it avoids unnecessary heap allocations.

## Best Practices and Industry Standards
- **Error Handling:** Always check the return value of `stat()` to handle potential errors (e.g., file not found, permission denied).
- **Security Considerations:** Avoid passing user-generated input directly without sanitization to prevent security vulnerabilities.
- **Efficiency:** The function uses stack memory for performance optimization.

## Summary
- The `check_dir` function efficiently checks if a file path is a directory.
- It leverages the `stat` system call and `S_ISDIR` macro for verification.
- Uses static memory allocation, avoiding unnecessary heap usage.
- Follows industry best practices for error handling and security.
