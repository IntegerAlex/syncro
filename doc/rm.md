### Documentation for `remove_files` Function

---

#### **Overview**

The `remove_files` function removes specified file paths from a `trackable.txt` file. It reads the contents of the file, compares each line to a set of paths to be removed, and writes back only the paths that are not part of the removal list. This function is primarily designed for use in file tracking systems where certain file paths need to be dynamically excluded.

---

#### **Function Declaration**

```c
char* remove_files(char* path[], int n);
```

- **Parameters:**
  - `path[]`: An array of character pointers (`char*[]`), each pointing to a file path to be removed from the `trackable.txt`.
  - `n`: An integer representing the number of paths to be removed.

- **Returns:**
  - A `char*` indicating the success or failure of the operation. On success, it returns `"Files removed successfully"`. On error, it returns an error message like `"Error opening file"`.

---

#### **Detailed Explanation**

1. **Opening the File for Reading:**
   ```c
   FILE *file = fopen("./.syncro/refs/trackable.txt", "r");
   ```
   - The function begins by opening the `trackable.txt` file in **read mode** (`"r"`). This file contains the paths that are being tracked. If the file cannot be opened (e.g., it doesn't exist), the function returns an error message.

2. **Reading the File Contents:**
   ```c
   char existing_paths[1024][1024]; // Max 1024 lines, 1024 chars per line
   int line_count = 0;
   ```
   - A 2D character array `existing_paths` is used to store the paths read from the file. It has space for up to 1024 paths, with each path having a maximum length of 1024 characters.
   - `line_count` is a counter used to track the number of lines read.

   ```c
   while (fgets(existing_paths[line_count], sizeof(existing_paths[line_count]), file)) {
       existing_paths[line_count][strcspn(existing_paths[line_count], "\n")] = '\0'; // Remove newline
       line_count++;
   }
   ```
   - The `fgets` function reads each line from the file and stores it in `existing_paths`. The `strcspn` function removes the trailing newline character (`\n`) from the end of each line.

3. **Closing the File After Reading:**
   ```c
   fclose(file);
   ```
   - After all lines are read, the file is closed.

4. **Opening the File for Writing:**
   ```c
   file = fopen("./.syncro/refs/trackable.txt", "w");
   ```
   - The file is then reopened in **write mode** (`"w"`) to allow the contents to be overwritten with the modified list of paths.

5. **Removing Specified Paths:**
   ```c
   for (int i = 0; i < line_count; i++) {
       int to_remove = 0;
       for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
           if (strcmp(existing_paths[i], path[j]) == 0) {
               to_remove = 1;
               break;
           }
       }
       if (!to_remove) {
           fprintf(file, "%s\n", existing_paths[i]);
       }
   }
   ```
   - For each path in `existing_paths`, a comparison is performed against each path in the `path[]` array (the paths to be removed).
   - If a match is found (using `strcmp`), a flag `to_remove` is set to 1, indicating that the path should not be written back to the file.
   - If the path is not to be removed, it is written back to the file using `fprintf`.

6. **Closing the File After Writing:**
   ```c
   fclose(file);
   ```
   - After updating the file with the new list of paths, the file is closed.

7. **Return Status:**
   ```c
   return "Files removed successfully";
   ```
   - If the operation completes successfully, the function returns a success message.

### **Memory Allocation**

#### **Static Memory Allocation**

1. **`existing_paths` Array**:
   - `char existing_paths[1024][1024];` is a **statically allocated** 2D array. This means memory for storing file paths is pre-allocated at compile-time. 
   - The array can hold up to 1024 file paths, with each path having a maximum length of 1024 characters.
   - The disadvantage of this static allocation is that memory usage is fixed and cannot be adjusted based on the actual number of file paths. If the file contains more than 1024 paths or if the paths are longer than 1024 characters, memory overflow or truncation may occur.

#### **Dynamic Memory Allocation**

The function does not use dynamic memory allocation (e.g., `malloc` or `calloc`). However, if dynamic memory allocation were used, the `existing_paths` array could be replaced with a dynamically allocated array of strings. This would allow for more flexible memory usage, especially if the number of lines in the file is unknown or variable.

Here’s how dynamic memory allocation could be incorporated:

```c
char** existing_paths = (char**)malloc(n * sizeof(char*));
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    existing_paths[i] = (char*)malloc(MAX_PATH_LENGTH * sizeof(char));
}
```
- Here, `existing_paths` is a dynamically allocated array of pointers to strings. Each string is allocated individually to hold file paths, giving flexibility in handling varying numbers of file paths and varying lengths of paths.

---

### **Error Handling**

- **File Open Errors**: If the file cannot be opened in either read or write mode, `perror` is used to print a system-defined error message. This is followed by returning a string indicating the error type.
- **General Error Handling**: The function returns specific error messages like `"Error opening file"` and `"Error writing file"`, which helps with debugging.

---

### **Industry Standard Practices**

1. **Memory Management**:
   - While the function uses static memory allocation, modern software typically prefers dynamic memory allocation when the number of elements (in this case, file paths) is unknown.
   - Proper error handling and memory management are critical in industry practices. For example, in a dynamic memory allocation approach, the function should also ensure that memory is freed after use to avoid memory leaks.

2. **Error Reporting**:
   - Returning specific error messages, such as `"Error opening file"` or `"Error writing file"`, is a standard practice. In professional environments, these messages would likely be replaced with proper logging to a file or monitoring system.

3. **Scalability**:
   - This code is limited by the maximum array size of 1024 paths, which could be improved with dynamic memory allocation if scalability is a concern.

4. **Code Readability**:
   - The function’s code is clean and well-commented, making it easy to understand. Adhering to consistent coding standards and documentation is crucial in a team setting.
