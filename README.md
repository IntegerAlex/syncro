Syncro
======

Syncro is a **version control system (VCS)** inspired by Git. It is a minimal implementation designed for learning purposes, offering insight into how version control systems work under the hood. Syncro provides basic functionality to manage and track changes in files and directories.

This project is open to collaboration and contributions from developers interested in version control systems or learning low-level implementations of such tools.

Features
--------
- Initialize repositories with a structured directory layout.
- Track changes and manage references (branches and tags).
- Simple implementation to understand core VCS concepts.

Purpose
-------
Syncro was created as a personal project to explore the internals of version control systems like Git. It aims to demystify concepts like:
- Directory and file structure for versioning.
- References (e.g., branches and tags).
- HEAD management.

Getting Started
---------------
### Prerequisites
- GCC or any C compiler
- Basic understanding of C programming and file systems.

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/IntegerAlex/syncro.git cd syncro

2. Build the project:

`make`

3. Run the executable:

`./build/vcs init`

### Usage
- **Initialize a repository**:  

`./build/vcs init`

This creates a `.syncro` directory with the necessary structure for version control.

Contributing
------------
We welcome contributions! Hereâ€™s how you can help:
1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your feature:

`git checkout -b feature-name`

3. Commit your changes:

`git commit -m "Add feature-name"`

4. Push to your branch:
